        <h4>Story Overview:-</h4>
        <p>The Originals, a spin-off from The Vampire Diaries, centers on three of the Mikaelson siblings: Klaus (Joseph
            Morgan), Elijah (Daniel Gillies), and Rebekah (Claire Holt). The Mikaelson family are also commonly known as
            "the Originals" due to the fact that they are the first vampires ever to exist. Niklaus "Klaus" Mikaelson is
            the son of a witch and a werewolf, and his quest to unleash his hybrid nature was detailed in The Vampire
            Diaries. The backdoor pilot, which aired on April 25, 2013, also revealed that the werewolf Hayley (Phoebe
            Tonkin), with whom Klaus had a drunken one-night stand, is pregnant with his child. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The series begins with the Original siblings returning to the city of New Orleans for the first time since
            1919, where a pregnant Hayley has also settled. Having originally built the French Quarter, they had been
            forced to abandon it when fleeing from their vengeful father, Mikael (Sebastian Roché). In their absence,
            Klaus's protégé, Marcel (Charles Michael Davis), took charge of the French Quarter. Klaus resolves that they
            must take down Marcel and get back the city that once belonged to them. While doing that, they must also
            protect their city from a war brewing between vampires, werewolves, and witches. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The first season describes how Klaus's mystical child is going to be born and speaks of the threats that the
            Originals together must keep her safe from.
            The second season deals with the return of Klaus and his siblings' parents, and the arrival of an aunt who
            threatens the baby's life.
            The third season shows the Mikaelsons facing both a prophecy that speaks of their downfall and the first
            generation of non-Original vampires which they sired, who have wanted revenge against the Mikaelsons for
            nearly a millennium.
            The fourth season jumps ahead five years, with the Mikaelsons returning to New Orleans and having to face a
            reawakened ancient mystical menace set on destroying anything in its path. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The fifth and final season of the series takes place seven years after the fourth season, with Hope now being
            a teenager at a school for supernatural children, the Salvatore Boarding School for the Young and Gifted and
            the Mikaelsons still having to face the ancient menace from the previous season while trying to re-unite
            their family once again. </p>

                    Mikaelson :</a></span>Elijah is the third born child to Esther and Mikael. Elijah first appears in
            "Rose", the eighth episode of the second season of The Vampire Diaries. He is brought into the circle by two
            vampires named Rose and Trevor. They make a deal to be allowed immunity from Elijah and the Originals if
            they hand over Elena Gilbert, the new Petrova doppelgänger. It is later revealed that Rose and Trevor were
            the vampires who failed to keep Katerina Petrova (Katherine Pierce) alive for Klaus to sacrifice in the
            ritual required to become a vampire/werewolf Hybrid.

            Elijah had feelings for Katerina in 1492 (perhaps due to her resemblance to Tatia, a former doppelgänger he
            was in love with), and tried to save her from Klaus; however, she did not trust Elijah and chose to flee.
            Later, he would punish her for her betrayal by compelling her to stay in a tomb until he said otherwise.
